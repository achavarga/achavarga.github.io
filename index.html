										<p>
											Iâ€™m currently Assistant Professor and Research Coordinator in the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program at Touro University's School of Health Sciences. I have spent almost fifteen years as a Visual Neuroscience and Psychophysics researcher, and more than ten of those years as an instructor of Research Methods and Statistics.</p>

                                        <p>I received my Ph.D. in Cognition, Brain, and Behavior at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. My primary research focus was the contribution of low spatial frequency information to rapid object recognition, and enhancement of visual sensitivity to these spatial frequencies using temporal modulation. I continue to do research in visual psychophysics, as well as research pedagogy. </p>
            
                                        <p>In addition to my own research, I have collaborated with faculty from Physical Therapy, Clinical Psychology, Chemistry, Communications, Speech Pathology, and Education as a statistician and research coodinator. In my role as coordinator of programs for the Center for Achievement in Science Education (CASE), I advised research-interested students across the disciplines in the natural and behavioral sciences, and developed a wide variety of professional development and academic workshops. Holistic student mentoring and workforce development is an integral part of what I consider my personal mission as an effective researcher and educator.  </p>

                           <p><b>ViBE: Vision & Balance Education Initiative</b><br>
                 Dr. Alla Chavarga, an expert in visual psychophysics and neuroscience, and Leah Verebes, a geriatric certified specialist at the Touro University School of Health Sciences are partnering with local community centers and physical therapy providers to develop a research and community education program to offer vision and balance screenings to underserved geriatric populations in New York City.  As part of this initiative, participating institutions receive educational seminars aimed at teaching best practices in fall prevention, vision preservation, and home modifications to promote safety and reduce fall risk due to poor balance or impaired visual sensitivity. Students from the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program will join these efforts and participate in community engagement through balance and vision screening, and creation of accessible educational materials for distribution to PT clinics and community residents. Partners include the Educational Alliance Naturally Occurring Retirement Community and ProHealth Physical Therapy.</p>
                  
                  <p><b>Spatio-temporal Contrast Sensitivity and Object Recognition</b><br>
                  The major function of the human visual system is to effectively identify objects and scenes. Research has shown that this process is largely top-down in nature, with initial processing at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) triggering a cascade of activations in higher-order memory, language, and form-detecting brain areas. Certain spatial components of an image, namely coarse low spatial frequencies (LSFs) may be prioritized in the identification process. We use counterphase flicker to selectively enhance sensitivity to LSFs in images of everyday objects and scenes to assess recognition ability. This intervention may improve object recognition in vision compromised by disease, age, or environmental conditions. </p>
                  
                  <p><b>Describing Color Appearance: Hue Scaling and the Uniform Appearance Diagram</b><br>
                  A wide variety of standard spaces have been developed to describe color appearance, all of which relate wavelengths to the three-parameter physiological specification corresponding to the three retinal cone-types, S, M, and L. However, sensory experience of color can be directly magnitude-estimated using hue and saturation scaling, a comprehensive but effective method for describing what a stimulus <i>looks like</i>. We transform this data onto a non-Euclidean two-dimensional color <i>appearance</i> space that is capable of generating accurate predictions of behavioral color discrimination (delta lambda), as well as changes in color sensation due to simultaneous contrast.</p>
                  
                  <p><b>Contrast Sensitivity in Special Populations</b><br>
                  As part of a comprehesive battery of visual tests, we evaluate basic visual function (acuity, color vision, stereopsis, and contrast sensitivity) in an array of unique subpopulations with visual systems or functioning that is characteristically divergent from the normal population. These groups include children, individuals advanced in age, individuals with Down Syndrome, Schizophrenia, visual artists, and those with some form of color blindness or anomaly. </p><br>

													<h4>Mental Rotation and Visual Field Preference in a Drawing Task</h4>
													
													<!--project popup description-->
														<p><br>
                  This project investigates whether there exists a lateralized visual field preference in viewing and drawing objects in space as a function of handedness, eye dominance, mental rotation ability, and the native written language. This project was designed to provide an authentic research experience and opportunity to learn quantitative analysis for student researchers without substantial prior research experience.</p>

													<h4>Peer-Assisted Team Research: An Early Research Experience Intervention</h4>
													
													<!--project popup description-->
													<p>
														Peer-Assisted Team Research (PATR) is an early research experience method created to introduce and immerse freshmen and sophomore students in authentic scientific research. Borrowing from the principles of the C.R.E.A.T.E. guided article reading (City College, CUNY), and intensive research immersion, PATR takes students through the full scientific life cycle, from hypothesis generation to data collection, analysis, and presentation. Student perceptions following PATR experience reveal increased self-efficacy and interest in pursuing science.

														Amidst a plethora of mainstream media documentaries and autobiographical television shows depicting the life experiences of primarily women in Orthodox Judaism, little is known about population-wide trends and life experiences of those who disaffiliate from Orthodoxy. Our research aims to investigate the reasons for leaving reported by formerly Orthodox, or Off the Derech (OTD) individuals.

													<h4>Eye Color and Vision</h4>
													
													<!--project popup description-->
													<p>
														The genetic contributions to cone polymorphism (and related color vision ability) may similarly underlie the determinants of iris pigmentation. Previous research has reported conflicting evidence of the relationship between iris reflectance and an arrangement test of hue discrimination (FM100). We assess the relationship between iris summed reflectance and color vision ability using direct hue-scaling of monochromatic lights. This technique allows us to derive wavelength discrimination (Delta Lambda) from a function representing the psychological color space referred to as the Uniform Appearance Diagram.
